# **Project Plan**

Creating a JavaScript application that utilizes RAG with an embedding model, an LLM, and a vector store database.

Here’s a structured approach to help you get started:

1. **Project Structure**  
   **Frontend**: A web application for users to upload documents and submit searches.
   **Backend**: A server that handles document uploads, embeddings, and queries to the LLM.
   **Models**: Local instances of the embedding model and LLM.
   Vector Store: A database to store and retrieve document embeddings.
2. Technology Stack
   Frontend: Use a framework like React, Vue, or Angular for building the user interface.
   Backend: Use Node.js with Express for handling API requests.
   Embedding Model: You can use libraries like TensorFlow.js or ONNX.js to run models locally.
   LLM: Consider using a local instance of a model like GPT-2 or GPT-3 (if you have access) or a smaller model that can run locally.
   Vector Store: Qdrant is a good choice for a vector store, and it has a REST API that you can interact with from your Node.js backend. Alternatively, you can use other vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate, depending on your requirements.

4. Containerization
   Use Docker to containerize your application components:
   Create a Dockerfile for the backend server.
   Create a Dockerfile for the vector store (if using Qdrant, you can use the official Qdrant Docker image).
   Optionally, create a Dockerfile for the frontend if you want to containerize it as well.

5. Development Workflow
   Set Up the Backend:
   Create an Express server that handles document uploads and API requests.
   Implement endpoints for uploading documents, generating embeddings, and querying the LLM.
6. Integrate the Embedding Model:
   Load the embedding model in your backend and create a function to generate embeddings for uploaded documents.
7. Set Up the Vector Store:
   Use Qdrant to store the embeddings. Implement functions to insert embeddings into the vector store and query them based on user searches.
   Integrate the LLM:
   Load the LLM in your backend and create a function to handle search queries. This function should retrieve relevant embeddings from the vector store and use them to generate responses.
   Build the Frontend:
   Create a user interface that allows users to upload documents and submit search queries.
   Implement API calls to the backend to handle document uploads and search requests.

8. Example Project Structure

/project-root
├── /frontend // Frontend application
│ ├── src
│ ├── public
│ └── Dockerfile // Dockerfile for frontend
├── /backend // Backend application
│ ├── src
│ ├── models // Embedding and LLM models
│ └── Dockerfile // Dockerfile for backend
├── /vector-store // Qdrant or other vector store
│ └── Dockerfile // Dockerfile for vector store
├── docker-compose.yml // Docker Compose file to manage containers
└── README.md // Project documentation

6. Docker Compose
   Use Docker Compose to manage your containers. Here’s a simple example of a docker-compose.yml file:

version: '3.8'
services:
frontend:
build:
context: ./frontend
ports: - "3000:3000"

backend:
build:
context: ./backend
ports: - "5000:5000"
depends_on: - vector-store

vector-store:
image: qdrant/qdrant
ports: - "6333:6333"

7. Testing and Deployment
   Local Testing: Test each component locally to ensure they work together.
   Deployment: Consider deploying your application using a cloud provider or a platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
8. Documentation
   Document your code and provide clear instructions for setting up and running the project. This will help others (and yourself) understand the project in the future.
